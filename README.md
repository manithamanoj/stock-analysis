##VBA analysis
##Introduction
      
      In this Module 2 challenge we are going to refactor the code to make the code more efficient.Then We will check whether the refactoring has helped to decrease the run time of  the VBA script.

##Challenge Back ground
    Steve just finished his finance degree and an excel savvy. His parents would like to invest in stocks and asked his expertise to take a decision. Here we used excel with VBA scripting to analyze the entire stock. We helped Steve to  create a workbook analyze 2017 and 2018 stock he is pretty much happy with that. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.
